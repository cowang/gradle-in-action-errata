=== Page 46, section 2.6.4, last paragraph

The runtime behavior of the Gradle daemon can be explained in more detail. The following paragraph is more explicit about its use from the command line:

____
Subsequent invocations of the `gradle` command will now reuse the daemon process. Give it a shot and try running `gradle groupTherapy --daemon`. Wow, you got your startup and execution time down to about one second! Keep in mind...
____

____
Give it a shot and try running `gradle groupTherapy --daemon`. Wow, you got your startup and execution time down to about one second! Subsequent invocations of the `gradle` command will need to declare the `--daemon` option explicitly. In practice you might want to configure the daemon with the help of a system properties to reuse an already started daemon process. For more information on the daemon's configuration, check out the online documentation at http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:gradle_configuration_properties. Keep in mind...

=== Page 56, command line output

As the sample project doesn't provide any unit tests, the `reports` directory won't exist after running a full build.

The syntax for declaring a custom Maven repository was incorrect. There should be no comma and closing parenthesis.

    mavenCentral()

The first two task names of the graph (light blue boxes) are incorrect. They should be called `compileJava` and `processResources` instead of `compileTestJava` and `processTestResources`.

=== Page 191, chapter 8

The plugin implementation described in chapter 8 relies on RUN@Cloud for deploying and hosting a web application. Unfortunately, Cloudbees decided to link:https://www.cloudbees.com/faq-customers-runcloud[decommission their service RUN@Cloud] on December 31, 2014. 

What does this mean for readers of this chapter?

- You cannot create an account on RUN@Cloud anymore as described in section 8.1.
- The business logic implemented by the plugin described in chapter 8 will not work as is.
- The Gradle concepts explained in chapter 8 are still highly relevant for Gradle plugin development and are applicable outside of the context used to demonstrate deployment and web application management functionality.

If you want to follow along with the content and try to run the examples, I'd suggest you select a different PaaS provider with similar capabilities. I won't give any suggestions here as they might get easily outdated as well. A Google should provide you with same valid proviers. If you don't want to rely on an external provide, you could also rewrite the plugin such that it deploys the application to a local instance of Apache Tomcat by making calls to the Tomcat manager.

=== Page 225, first code snippet

The class `AntBuilder` is an abstract class and therefore cannot be instantiated. To create an instance of type `AntBuilder` from a regular class, you will need to use Groovy's `AntBuilder` implementation. Gradle's AntBuilder implementations aren't part of the public API. Using internal Gradle classes is not a recommended practice as the class or package might change with a later version of Gradle.

    def ant = new org.gradle.api.AntBuilder()

should be

    def ant = new groovy.util.AntBuilder()

The image doesn't properly render the `jshint` assignment. It should say `all: ['src/main/webapp/js/app/*.js']`. The title `Gruntfile.js` is partially cut off.

=== Page 356, figure 13.26

The image shows a different build number for each build step e.g. `#11 todo-initial`, `#4 todo-integ-tests`. However,
with the proper configuration each build step should use the build number defined by the initial step of the pipeline e.g. `#11 todo-initial`, `#11 todo-integ-tests`.

____
As the build step, you want to trigger the execution of your integration tests. Add a build step for invoking your Gradle script using the wrapper and enter the task `databaseIntegrationTest`.
